<h2>Why I enjoy these foods</h2>
<p>"Rice is a staple in Asian cuisine, and after eating it for my whole life, I have grown quite fond of it. Burgers and steak I enjoy because of the meat. I enjoy eating meat, the juicy and meaty flavors really get me. Spaghetti I enjoy because of the tomato sauce and meatballs. I normally coat my spaghetti with parmesan cheese, which is a must for me." </p> 
<h2>Why I use these websites</h2>
<p>"Youtube is a website that contains millions of different videos on different subjects. You can watch funny videos, educational videos, or make your own videos for people to watch. Wikipedia has somewhat accurate information on a broad variety of subjects, which I enjoy reading."</p>
